## Installation

No installation needed. If you do download code, this can be run by Node or Nodemon locally.

## Usage

The user will need to register an account in order to be able to play. After signing up, or logging into your account, the user will be taken to their dashboard. The dashboard will consist of the ability to create new pets or be able to view any existing pets. The user will only be allowed to create a maximum of 3 pets. A modal will be prompted when the user chooses to create a new pet. Right now, the user can choose the type of pet they want and name them. After creating a new pet, it will now be available to be viewed in the dashboard. When the user clicks on the pet, they will be taken to a page specifically for that pet and interactions. The user, as of now, have three choices: feed, nap, and play. The user needs to keep the pet fed in order to be able to play with it more. The user also needs to ensure that the pet's energy level is kept up, or else it will be too tired to play. In order to keep it's friendship up, the user will need to play with it.

Any hopes for the future is the ability to change the pet's appearance to any color. I also would like to expand the world, like having the user be able to play minigames to earn money and use that money to buy a variety of food or toys for their pets. I would also like for the pets to have their own randomly generate favorite foods and dislikes. More customization to the pets would be preferred, like being able to dress them up. Also add like a spotlight page so you can view other users' pets.
